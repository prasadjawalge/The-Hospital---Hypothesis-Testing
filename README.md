## The-Hospital---Hypothesis-Testing
This readme file provides an overview of the analysis conducted for 'The Hospital'. The goal of this analysis was to address the company's questions regarding the prediction of hospitalization reasons for different regions and the relationship between variables such as viral load, smoking, severity level, and hospitalization charges.

## Data Analysis Steps:
## Data Preprocessing:
The dataset provided for analysis was cleaned and prepared for further analysis.
Missing values, if any, were handled appropriately using suitable techniques such as imputation or exclusion.
Outlier detection was performed using the IQR (Interquartile Range) method to identify and handle any extreme values.

## Exploratory Data Analysis:
Univariate analysis was conducted to understand the distribution, summary statistics, and characteristics of individual variables.
Bivariate analysis was performed to explore the relationships between different variables, specifically focusing on variables related to hospitalization reasons and charges.
Statistical analysis techniques were employed to calculate measures such as means, standard deviations, and correlations to gain insights into the data.

## Hypothesis Testing:
Hypothesis testing was conducted to determine the significance of variables in predicting the reason for hospitalization for different regions.
Statistical tests, such as chi-square tests or t-tests, were applied to assess the association between variables and hospitalization reasons.
Additionally, the relationship between variables like viral load, smoking, severity level, and hospitalization charges was evaluated using suitable statistical tests.

## Results and Insights:
Based on the analysis conducted, the following insights were derived:
Identification of significant variables in predicting the reason for hospitalization in different regions.
Evaluation of the impact and significance of variables like viral load, smoking, and severity level in describing hospitalization charges.
The findings from this analysis will help 'The Hospital' gain a better understanding of the factors influencing hospitalization reasons and charges. These insights can assist in improving decision-making processes, resource allocation, and overall operational efficiency.
